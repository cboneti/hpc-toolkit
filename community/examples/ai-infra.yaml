# talking points -- what is possible here
# - This module is really short with the toolkit: foundational modules.
#     The tech is good, ew solve a number of problems that will be relevant for you.
# - Easy to extend in new infrastructure, file systems, schedulers.
# - Adding custom startup scripts
# - In a few lines, we could build an image from ai-infra outputs
